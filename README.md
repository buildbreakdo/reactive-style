| Nothing&nbsp;new to learn | &#10004;       |              | With Style It, you use the same familiar CSS syntax you already know and love -- now inside of your components. Just wrap your component with Style It and start writing CSS. |
| Fully featured        | &#10004;       |              | There is no abstraction to go through -- Style It is just CSS. Use any CSS feature available. |
| Scoped selectors      | &#10004;       |              | Move your CSS out of the global name space. Style It automatically scopes selectors for you to the component's root element and acts as a polyfill for sub-tree scoping (learn more on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLStyleElement/scoped)). |
| [Layout styling](#layout-styling) | &#10004;       |              | Style your layout without using an external CSS file. Style It makes keeping all of your CSS in the App component hierarchy easy -- from global layout to component specific styles. |

### Installation

Install with npm.

```sh
npm install style-it --save
```

Alternatively, if you are not using npm as your package manager the files can be downloaded directly from the [npm content delivery network](https://unpkg.com/style-it/).

### Usage
Style It takes advantage of ES2015 / ES6 specification for Template Literals (previously "template strings") to write plaintext CSS in JavaScript. Use of Template Literals enables multi-line strings, string interpolation, and use of curley brackets / braces to declare CSS rules in JSX.

Template Literals are enclosed by the back-tick (\` \`) (grave accent) character instead of double or single quotes. Learn more about Template Literals on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals).

#### Component with Component Root Node [<img title="OPEN IN JSFIDDLE" align="right" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/OPEN%20IN%20JSFIDDLE--eaeff2.svg" />](https://jsfiddle.net/1332n40w/3/)
Let's say we have two components `ParentComponent` and `ChildComponent` defined as follows (note the root node in the `ParentComponent` is another component):

```js
...
class ParentComponent extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <ChildComponent>
                <p> Some stuff </p>
            </ChildComponent>
        )
    }
}
...
```

```js
...
class ChildComponent extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                {this.props.children}
            </div>
        )
    }
}
...
```

The child component is a typical passthrough component, that takes the props (in this case `<p> Some stuff </p>`) and renders them.

A core feature of Style It are scopes, you do not have to worry about global CSS name collisions because each CSS rule is scoped to it's own sub-tree (poly-like fill for [scoped attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLStyleElement/scoped)). To achieve this, a scoping className is added. This works automagically when component root nodes are types like `<div>`, `<span>`, `<p>`, etc. When the root node of a component is another component, this becomes a much more tricky problem because it is not known how deep the component root node nesting will go (e.g., multiple passthrough components composed inside of one another).

For this reason, components which serve as root nodes for other components must have their `className` attribute set to `this.props.className` to have the CSS scoping class name properly set (without the scope class name CSS styles will not apply). So the ChildComponent (since it is used as a root node in the ParentComponent) simply becomes:

```js
...
class ChildComponent extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div className={this.props.className}>
                {this.props.children}
            </div>
        )
    }
}
...
```

So all we added was an explicit className assignment from props (this snippet `className={this.props.className}`). Would argue that this is best practices anyway for a component that can be a root node; likely should simply use the spread operator (e.g., `{...this.props}`) to cover all your bases and include events a would be user of your component may attach. 

If you would like to play with this scenario online, you can [open this example in JSFIDDLE](https://jsfiddle.net/1332n40w/3/).

### Additional Usage

#### JavaScript variables in your CSS [<img title="OPEN IN JSFIDDLE" align="right" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/OPEN%20IN%20JSFIDDLE--eaeff2.svg" />](https://jsfiddle.net/y2pnqh9e/44/)
In:
```js
import React from 'react';
import Style from 'style-it';

class Intro extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const fontSize = 13;

    return Style.it(`
      .intro {
        font-size: ${ fontSize }px;  // ES2015 & ES6 Template Literal string interpolation
      }
      .package {
        color: blue;
      }
      .package:hover {
        color: aqua;
      }
    `,
      <p className="intro">CSS-in-JS made simple -- just Style It.</p>
    );
  }
}

export default Intro;
```

Out:
```html
<p class="intro _scoped-1">
  <style type="text/css">
    ._scoped-1.intro {
      font-size: 13px;
    }
    ._scoped-1 .package {
      color: blue;
    }
    ._scoped-1 .package:hover {

#### Layout styling[<img title="OPEN IN JSFIDDLE" align="right" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/OPEN%20IN%20JSFIDDLE--eaeff2.svg" />](https://jsfiddle.net/y2pnqh9e/45/)
Style your layout without using an external CSS file. Style It makes keeping all of your CSS in the App component hierarchy easy -- from global layout to component specific styles (uses JSX syntax).

In:
```js
import React from 'react';
import Style from 'style-it';

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Style>
          {`
            body {
              font-size: small;
              font-family: arial;
            }
            h1 {
              font-size: large;
            }
            h2 {
              font-size: medium;
            }
            h3 {
              font-size: small;
            }
            a {
              color: blue;
            }
            a:hover {
              color: aqua;
            }
         `}
        </Style>

        <header />
        <main />
        <footer />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Out:
```html
<div>
  <style type="text/css">
    body {
      font-size: small;
      font-family: arial;
    }
    h1 {
      font-size: large;
    }
    h2 {
      font-size: medium;
    }
    h3 {
      font-size: small;
    }
    a {
      color: blue;
    }
    a:hover {
      color: aqua;
    }
  </style>

  <header></header>
  <main></main>
  <footer></footer>
</div>
```
